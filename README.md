The scheduler time slots change colors for past(gray), present(red), and future(green). The text boxes allow a user to type in one or more tasks by the hour and save to local storage. There is an ability to reset the schedulers time slots. The scheduler has a running time clock in the header for one to best interpret time management in relation to a users scheduled tasks.
## PROBLEM AND SOLUTION
THE PROBLEM is a users lack of scheduling can lead to daily routines being missed or delayed. THE SOLUTION is to develop a daily scheduler that will stream line a users daily routines and activities.
